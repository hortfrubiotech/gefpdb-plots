#Homocedasticity analysis

This shiny app performs a graphic and statistical analyisis of the data homogenity of variance over a dataset selected by the user. 

The data is retrieved from a Chado DB and ploted in an Boxplot. In addition three statistical tests for homocedasticity are applied, Bartlett test, Levene's test and Fligner-Killen test of homogenity of varainces. 

An example of one of the plot outputs:
