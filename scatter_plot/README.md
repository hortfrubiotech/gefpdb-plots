#Scatter plot
  
This shiny app retrieves data from a Chado DB, creates scatter plot and performs a correlation analysis of two variable. Here is used to compare two biological phenotypic data from a collection of GMO strawberry. The user can select both attributes, the stock and the year when data were collected. 
The correlation coefficient and the corresponding P value for the interaction between the two attributes are showed as labels in the plot.
