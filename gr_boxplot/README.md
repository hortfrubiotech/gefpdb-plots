#Grouped Boxplot

This shiny app retrieves data from a Chado DB and creates a grouped barplot. Here is used to visualize biological phenotypic data from a collection of GMO strawberry. Therefore the user can select both attributes and stocks. The app uses the user input to represent the selected values grouping the data by year.

An example of the plot output:
